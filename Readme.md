This study presents a comprehensive end-to-end framework for Predictive Maintenance
(PdM) for components in a Microgrid, with a focus on Vertical Axis Wind Turbines and
Energy Storage Systems. The proposed framework integrates the development of tailored
hardware for data acquisition, predictive model development, and a Digital Twin (DT)
that provides real-time data visualization and future operating condition predictions. We
integrate all components of the PdM system, including the data collection hardware, pre-
dictive models, and the DT, into a unified application using Microsoft Azure as the backend
system. This comprehensive framework serves as a scalable and robust solution for imple-
menting PdM, providing a clear pathway to reduce maintenance costs and improve system
reliability in industrial settings. The results indicate that this comprehensive framework can
substantially reduce maintenance costs while enhancing system resilience and sustainability,
as demonstrated through a real-world use case for wind turbines.
